    "\n",
    "* How it relates to value investing?\n",
    "\n",
    "* No uniform definition\n",
    "  - Profitable\n",
    "  - Safe\n",
    "  - Good governance\n",
    "  - Good growth – asset growth, earnings growth, etc.\n",
    "  - High payout\n",
    "  - Creditworthy\n",
    "  - Well managed\n",
    "  - Accounting quality – accruals, earnings stability, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Relation to value investing\n",
    "   - Buying high quality assets without paying premium prices is another form of value investing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does quality carry a premium on its own?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Simple Quality Metric -- Profitability!**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple quality measure = gross profitability = (revenues – COGS)/assets from [Novy-Marx,2013](http://rnm.simon.rochester.edu/research/OSoV.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common recurring theme is the strong relation between quality and value\n",
    "  - Quality can even be viewed as an alternative implementation of value\n",
    "  - Buying high quality assets without paying premium prices is just as much value investing as buying average quality assets at a discount\n",
    "  - Warren Buffett, “far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than to buy a fair business at a wonderful price.” \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quality and value strategies are dissimilar, however, in the stocks that they actually hold\n",
    "  - High quality firms tend to be expensive, while value firms tend to be low quality\n",
    "  - Quality strategies are thus short value, while value strategies are short quality. \n",
    "  - Each of these strategies consequently tends to do well precisely when the other under-performs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Value stocks are cheap -> high expected returns and growth stocks are expensive ->  low expected returns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar arguments suggest that firms with productive assets should yield higher average returns than firms with unproductive assets \n",
    "  - Profitable firms that investors demand high average returns to hold should be priced similarly to less productive firms for which investors demand lower returns\n",
    "  - Variation in productivity identifies variation in required rates of return\n",
    "\n",
    "* This argument is consistent with both rational risk pricing and behavioral forces\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evidence:  gross-profits-to-assets strongly predicts returns, especially controlling for book-to-market (scaled price)\n",
    "  - Profitable firms have higher average returns than unprofitable firms\n",
    "  - Despite having, on average, lower book-to-markets and higher market capitalizations\n",
    "* Consequently, provides an incredibly valuable hedge for value strategies\n",
    "* Combination explains a whole host of accounting-based and earnings-related anomalies, including ROE, market power, default risk, net stock issuance, and organizational capital\n",

    "\n",
    "![image.png](../../assets/plots/othertradingstrategiesB2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You see that the Profitable minus Unprofitable portfolio has a very sizable alpha relative to the Fama-French 3 factors model( you can see this in the last line of the table in the left)\n",
    "\n",
    "* So much so that Fama and French added this factor to their 5 factor model, but they call RmW, Robust minus Weak\n",
    "\n",
    "* You see that the alphas are much higher than the premium because of the negative exposure to the value factor\n",
    "\n",
    "A great sucess of this strategy is that it helps price a variety of other strategies, so it is a grate factor because allow us to summarize the data better\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this on the table below where Robert compares the 4 factor alpha of a variety of trading strategies with the alpha after including the profitabiltiy factor\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](../../assets/plots/othertradingstrategiesB3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* comparing cloumns 2 and 3 you see that lots of the alphas became insignificant, what means that the profitabiltiy factor together with the other 4 factors help span the mean-variance frontier that includes these assets."
