First stepos with Python
=====================

Before diving into Python which we will do in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, we will start with the very basic ingridients of Python.

We will do this using the great material from https://inferentialthinking.com/.

Here is the content that you should look at

- Chapter 3, Programming in Python (including sub chapters): https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html
- Chapter 4,  Data Types: https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/04/Data_Types.html
- Chpater 5, Sequences:  https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/05/Sequences.html

You can manually download each chapter from their website.

Their other chapters are also great intro the data analitics, but are not necessary for our course.
