    "Visit [continuum.io](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the\n",
    "Anaconda Python distribution for your operating system (Windows/Mac OS/Linux).\n",

    "is added to your environment/path.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Mac OS and Linux, this should happen by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, we recommend installing for “just me” instead of “all users”. Windows users will need to **check the upper box** when the page shown below appears (disregard the “not recommended” warning from Anaconda).\n",

    "## Downloading the Quantitative investing notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "You have three options here\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download notebook by notebook as you use it. You can do that by clicking on the top right download buttom and selecting the `ipynb` option. You shoudl try doing this right now with this notebook. This is the simplest but some of the figures that you can see on the web will not render if you follow this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download everything at once: You can go in the top right and click on the button on the left of the download buttom (it looks like a cat). This is the github buttom, you can hover and choose the repository option. You then hover on the green buttom on the top right that says \"code\" and you should select the option \"download ZIP\". You then unzip the folders in your working folder. All notebooks will be in chapters. You can delete everything else exept folders \"assets\" and \"chapters\". Assets contains the figures that do not rended in method 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Github! If you know how to do this or want to learn that is the most efficient. But it can be a bit overwhelming if you are startign to code now!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating: If I change anything in the notebooks after you download?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you followed step 1 or 2 you cna jsut download again the indivudal notebook manually\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you follow step 3 you can use gihthub to handle this!\n",

    "## Package Management\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Jupyter, the Anaconda Python distribution comes with two package management tools `conda` and `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will help you ensure that you have the right packages (think of these as “add-ons” to Python\n",
    "that give you additional functionality… We will discuss these more in depth later!) and help you\n",
    "keep them all up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work through an example below to install some new package functionality needed for some\n",
    "later lectures. Generally, packages can be installed by using `conda install <package name>` or\n",
    "`pip install <package name>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please install the packages you will need later by following the instructions below for your\n",
