    "# Interpretating  Factor models\n",
    "\n",
    "## The academic view\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor models are models that describe how risk is priced in the economy\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you test a model, i.e., run a time-series regression you are testing if that model describes the risk-return trade-off in the economy\n",
    "\n",
    "- This a simultaneous test of (1) the proposed model and (2) whether markets are efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "- What does market efficiency means?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you find an alpha that is statistically different from zero, you either\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. reject the model\n",
    "   2. reject that markets are efficient\n",
    "   3. Or both\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **What you do with your portfolio really depends on what you believe**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If (2)--markets are inneficient-- then it is pretty clear what you should do. You should load on this \"anomaly\" because you believe that model describe how risk should be priced. So this alpha is mispricing. It is NOT a 100 dollar bill on the floor, becasue harvesting alpha is risky, but the higher the Appraisal ratio the more it * *looks* * like a 100 dollars bill. (An Arbitrage opportunity is the limit where this Appraisal ratio grows to infinity)\n",
    "    - In this (2) case you simply take into account the volatility and the comovement of the hedging portfolio with your portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "- If (1) and you reject the model. Now it is not so clear what you should do. Because you do have a view on what the proper model of risk and return is. So you don't know if this alpha is proper compensation for risks that you dot know. You might investigate and add this hedged portfolio as a factor if you think it captures some dimensions of risks that are important and not captured by your original model \n",
    "     - For example there is tons of wealth that is not traded in the stock market: housing, private business,your human capital, firms that have not being born yet\n",
    "     - It can be capturing risks associated with the banking sector like financial crisis, which might not be fully reflected in the stock market\n",
    "     - The factor can be caputring exposure to such risks and therefore it is a much more subtle question of whether you think your appetite for this risk is higher that the price of it (the appraisal ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **So after an rejection you need to do a post-morten to understand if you are in (1) or (2) and if you are in (1) what exactly is the kind of risk you are talkign about**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Practicioner view\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor models are used to describe invesestment strategies that are well known\n",
    "\n",
    "- Much less thought (incorrectly, imo) is given why these strategies work\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example: you add a value factor to your factor model (so a multi-factor model with  MKT and Value) not because you are taking a stand on the correct model, but simply to show that your strategy can add value even to someone that already has exposure to the market and the value factor. If your strategy has alpha, then you can claim that such investor can boost his Sharpe ratio by investing at least a bit in your strategy. The CAPM alpha by itself only answers this question for someone that has only an allocation to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So factors are used as a way to \"summarize\" some general risk-return feaures of the stock market (or any asset market), and by using these set of factors as \"benchmarks\" you can cleanly show your value added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The good practioner must have an understanding of where this alpha come from\n",
    "\n",
    "   - What are the mistakes that people are making?\n",
    "   - Why this persists?\n",
    "   - How would I be able to tell if this trade got \"crowded\" and will disappear going forward?\n",
    "   - Having a theory that is plausible and make sense is another way to guard agaisnt estiamtion uncertainty and data mining bias that we are always exposed to\n",
