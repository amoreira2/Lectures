For example, volatiltiy is highly clustered, so when we split the way we split above we are almost makign sure that the volatiltiy is about the same in both months. So this is not a great method to split if your strategy really depends on timing volaitltiy well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don't even need to split the samples equally, but you have to have in mind that a long sample is useful to both get precise point estimates (so you need a long estiamtion sample), but a logn sample is also required to have enought power to test. IF you make the test sample too short, you are guarantteing that you will fail to reject your reference portfolio"
